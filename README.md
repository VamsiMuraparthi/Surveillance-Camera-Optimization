## Introduction

Modern surveillance camera systems produce an overwhelming volume of data, making it essential to develop intelligent methods to store and manage this data efficiently. This project employs machine learning techniques to automatically filter, compress, and store surveillance footage based on its relevance, thereby reducing storage requirements while preserving the essential data for analysis and investigation.

## Features

- **Smart Storage Management**: The system uses machine learning models to determine the importance and relevance of different segments of surveillance footage, enabling efficient storage allocation.
  
- **Automatic Compression**: Machine learning algorithms automatically identify portions of footage that can be compressed without significant loss of information, optimizing storage utilization.

- **Customizable Policies**: Users can define storage policies based on specific requirements, allowing the system to adapt to different surveillance scenarios and objectives.

- **Alert Prioritization**: The system can prioritize storage space for footage related to specific alerts or events, ensuring critical data is preserved.

- **Intuitive Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard provides insights into storage usage, efficiency gains, and other relevant metrics.

## Algorithm

The core algorithm of this project consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Surveillance footage is collected from cameras and stored for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from the footage, such as motion, objects, and timestamps.
3. **Machine Learning Model**: A machine learning model (e.g., CNN, LSTM) processes the features to determine the importance of each segment.
4. **Storage Management**: The model's predictions are used to allocate storage space based on predefined policies.
5. **Compression**: Less critical segments are compressed using appropriate algorithms.
6. **Alert Prioritization**: Storage is prioritized for segments related to specific alerts or events.
7. **Dashboard Display**: Users can monitor storage usage, efficiency, and make adjustments through the dashboard.
